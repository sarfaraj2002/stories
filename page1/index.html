      <p7 class="text">
        The journey of life isn't that<br>
        difficult as we think......<br>
        Its just that even before starting the whole journey..<br>
        We start giving up on it<br>
      </p7>
      <p1 class="text">
        But we must Always remember one thing ...<br>
        Giving up shouldn't be an option at all <br>
        it just shows that you are not ready<br>
        to put in your ðŸ’¯ into it ...<br><br>
      </p1>
      <p2 class="text">
        We all know that,<br>
        people say and sometimes even we think of it<br>
        "WHAT IF I DON'T GET SUCCESS WHAT IF I FAIL"....<br>
        BUT life hasn't  ended yet the universe is still there,<br>
        the earth still rotates<br>
        Then, why do we think that the world ended?<br>
        You see? IT DIDN'T, life keeps going on and on<br><br>
      </p2>
      <p3 class="text">
        AND NEVER FEEL SAD WHEN YOU FAIL...<br>
        BECAUSE THAT'S just your first try <br>
        For the FIRST TIME in your LIFE you've learnt your mistake<br>
        Take that as learning and not failing,<br>
        Learnings would take you towards success
        and nothing else<br><br>
      </p3>
      <p4 class="text">
        Never follow others step<br>
        Follow your own steps<br>
        Walk on your thoughts.....<br>
        Not on others thought ðŸ’­<br><br>
      </p4>
      <p5 class="text">
        Create your own future <br>
        Not go on the future which is already created by others ...<br>
        Follow your heart<br>
        Other organs (people)will follow you back ðŸ”™<br><br>
      </p5>
      <p6 class="text">
        Hear your inner voice (Beautiful)<br>
        Not that noise that let you down (sound pollution)<br>
        Being different is not wrong...<br>
        It's Just that people are seeing you for the first time ..<br> <br>
