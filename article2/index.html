			<p class="content">Sleep is nothing but a state of rest in which your body is performing no task.Your body is just being inactive,your mind freezes, it doesn't think anything and your beautiful eyes are closed. Sleep is a method of refilling,recharging and healing. The most important part of sleep is it's spine DREAM. Dreaming is Fun , When you sleep and enter into the dreamland you escape from the real world not completely but at least for some time.<br><br> Sleep makes us feel enthusiastic and it's the best cure for all mental disorders.Whether you are facing anxiety,stress, whether you are in a bad mood or depressed just take a cushion and close your pretty eyes and just get away from all the problems. But if you are addicted to sleep and just obsessed with laying on bed then there's nothing wrong. It's just that you are healing yourself.But if you are a lot into sleep then you might be suffering from a condition named clinomania.If you sleep a lot then depressed can also be one of the cause and you just want to rest.<br><br> Well sleep has tons of benefits.Sleep is the best meditation you can practice.Sleep repairs the blood cells and give a lot of time for the mind to relax and calm down after having a hustle day. According to science you need an average sleep of 6-8 hours. Well it's not enough for people like me. But if you want enough sleep feel free to make your body inactive. Well,just make sure to accomplish your goals in real life too. Sleeping is very helpful in improving our memory. When you relax your memory improves and the brain becomes capable of processing information and data of the entire day's activity.<br><br> For those who love sleep are found to be more energetic. They have higher stamina and thereby they are more innovative. But it's so disappointing to see the youth having so much stress for exams,or meetings or a speech or doing something competitive. It makes us feel burdened when we have to face such crises because they sacrifice their precious sleep or keep on preparing things in a rush , instead of calming down and going into a virtual world. Sleeping is fun.Its a whole different world where no failures are visible. It's a world where what we want we get in. What we expect becomes reality. Only rare people enjoy this fun thing.Cause sleep doesn't come for everyone.Its just for special people. Indeed sleeping more is a very rare and cool talent.If you have it you just have an unique gift that everyone doesn't have. Feel proud you are talented and that talent isn't found in everyone.<br><br> Those who sleep are lot are also very beautiful cause they never face a problem of dark circles.ðŸ˜‚ So next time when you have to host a meeting or an exam, sleep 2 more hours and keep your mind fresh and innovative.</p>
